#5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters
# 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter the numbers from the book for problem 5.1 and Match the sample output below.


largest = None
smallest = None
store=[]
while True:
    try:
        num = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
        if num == "done" : break
        else:
           store.append(num)
    except:
        print("U have an invalid entry")

largest=max(store)
smallest=min(store)
print "Invalid input"
print "Maximum is",largest
print "Minimum is",smallest
