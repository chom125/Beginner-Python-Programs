#3.1 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay.
# Award time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program
# (the pay should be 498.75). You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the
# user input - assume the user types numbers properly.
# Now use error checking using try except

try:
    inp1 = raw_input("Enter Hours:")
    hours = float(inp1)
    inp2 = raw_input("Enter Rate per Hour:")
    rate = float(inp2)

except:
    print "Error, please enter numeric input"
    quit()

#print rate, hours

if hours <= 40 :
    pay = rate * hours

else:
    pay = rate * 40 + ( rate * 1.5 * ( hours - 40) )
    print "Your Pay is:", pay
